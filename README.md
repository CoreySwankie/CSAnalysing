# CoreySwankie_Gathered_Data_Analyser
**This Project Is No Longer Active So I Can Not Guarantee It Functions Correctly**
---
This is the webpage analyser code for the data gathered via the [CS Event Handler](https://github.com/CoreySwankie/CSEventHandler) plugin for Unity.
Initially this was intended to be a standalone program to be installed to desktop but due to project time constraints a webpage was created instead.
